# calculator

This is a project which implements a simple calculator. It just contains the basic arithmetic operations, and it supports decimals. Working on this project helped me to learn how to use event listeners more effectively. Also, it helped me get more comfortable working with Javascript, since I'm much more used to working in Java and C++ which feel very different.
